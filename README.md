# symfony-demo
A simple symfony demo based on https://pilsniak.com/docker-symfony/#TLDR_Recipe

To start choose either
- `make fast`: run the php from inside the image
- `make slow`: run the php remotely from the host

When the server is ready it will display:
```

 [OK] Server listening on http://0.0.0.0:8080

 // Quit the server with CONTROL-C.
```
